## Hello, my name is Bruno Piato
I'm an evolutionary biologist turning into a data scientist. In my masters I focused on evolutionary genetics and climate changes wich gave access to learn R programming language. Currently I am developing my Python skills along with Machine Learning and Data Analytics knowledge. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to easily visualize NBA player's data (https://nbadex.streamlit.app).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Machine Learning algorithms and Python programming.
- :scroll: I'm currently writing in my Medium blog https://medium.com/thevirtualenvironmentalist
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with new job opportunities.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: brunogpiato@gmail.com
