## Hello, my name is Bruno Piato
I'm a data scientist interested in providing companies with insights taken from data using my skills in machine learning and statistics. 

My first bachelor degree was in Biology and in my masters I focused on Evolutionary Genetics and climate changes, which gave access to learn R programming language and get in love with data science and analytics. 

Currently I am studying Data Science at Fatec Jundiaí university and developing my Python programming skills along with Machine Learning and Data Analytics knowledge through several portfolio projects that can be checked outin this GitHub profile page.

Feel free to browse around and get in touch with me in case I can help you with anything else.

# Main Projects

## <a href="https://github.com/brunopiato/RossmannProject">Rossmann sales prediction</a>

Rossmann company operates over 4,000 drugstores around European countries such as Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Israel and Spain with a revenue of over €10 billion.

In 2015 they published their data on Kaggle and created a Kaggle competition. The main goal was to predict the sales for the next 6 weeks once the CFO was intending to invest in improvements to the stores.

## <a href="https://github.com/brunopiato/InStyleNPS">InStyle NPS customers satisfaction prediction</a>

In this project we used a Kaggle dataset to train a supervised learning classification algorithm to predict the customer's satisfaction with the InStyle stores based on the Network Promoter Score and the client's experience.

## <a href="https://github.com/brunopiato/NBADex">NBAdex WebApp</a>

The NBA Players Dex is an app in which the NBA fan can visualize and inspect some data about their favorite player, comparing different player to visually access their similarity.

The WebApp can be accessed [here](https://nbadex.streamlit.app/).

## <a href="https://github.com/brunopiato/MachineLearning_Essay">Machine Learning algorithms essay</a>

An essay is the best way to compare different algorithms and hyperparameter fine-tuning in terms of their performance metrics. Here I tested five classification algorithms, ten regression models and three clustering algorithms.

## <a href="https://github.com/DataSolvers/IBM_EmployeeAttrition/tree/brunopiato">IBM Employee Attrition forecasting</a>

Employee attrition can be a big money sink for companies. Forecasting the employees with biggest attrition probabilities can be a strategic way to save money by understanding the main reason they would leave the company and act to prevent it.
